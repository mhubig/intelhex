Basic data inspection
*********************
You can get or modify some data by address in the usual way: 
via Python indexing operations::

    >>> print ih[0] # read data from address 0

When you need to work with 16-bit data stored in 8-bit Intel HEX files 
you need to use class ``IntelHex16bit``. This class is derived from IntelHex 
and has all its methods. Some of methods have been modified to implement 
16-bit behaviour.

This class assumes the data is in Little Endian byte order. 
The data can be accessed exactly like above, except that data returned will be 
16 bits, and the addresses should be word addresses.

Another useful inspection tool is the dump command. This will output 
the entire contents of the hex file to stdout or to a specified file like so::

    >>> ih.dump() # dump contents of ih to stdout in tabular hexdump format
    >>> ih.dump(tofile='hexdump.txt') # dump to specified file
