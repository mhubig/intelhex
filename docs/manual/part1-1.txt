The Intel HEX file format widely used in microprocessors and microcontrollers 
area as the de-facto standard for representation of code for programming 
microelectronic devices.

This work implements a HEX (also known as Intel HEX) file format reader 
and convertor to binary form as a python script.

Python package **intelhex** contains an implementation of a HEX file reader 
and convertor as the IntelHex class. Also included are some scripts 
to do basic tasks that utilize this package. The ``bin2hex.py`` script 
converts binary data to HEX, and the ``hex2bin.py`` works the other direction. 
``hex2dump.py`` converts data from HEX to a hexdump, and ``hexmerge.py`` 
merges multiple HEX files into one.
